# PO Editor

PO Editor is a small Rails and Backbone.js app to import and review PO files and automatically export changes almost in real time. Basically all translations are imported via a rake tasks in a sqlite database (for ease of export) and they can be then reviewed and edited through the webapp. Each time a translation is edited a request to regenerate a new PO file is made and is then handled via DelayedJob.

## Requirements

* Rails 3.0.x
* SQLite 3
* MySQL (for DelayedJob)

## Technical details

The webapp uses Rails 3.0.x for the moment due to some contraints while making the app it'll be upgraded later this year. Also you need two backends because due to other constraints I had to make locales exportable so I stored them in SQLite and the rest is handled in MySQL, due to this fact migrations can be quirky but I used <https://github.com/jystewart/multi-database-migrations> to overcome this problem so I strongly recommend reading the associated doc to perform migrations.

Concerning the PO import they can be made through the `locales:import[locale,/path/to/po/file.po]` rake task.
